    <h2> <em>Description</em></h2>
    <h3><p>Chin chin is a fried Nigerian snack. It is known as atchomon in Togo and Benin,
        achomo in Ghana and croquette in Cameroon. It is similar to Scandinavian snack klenat, a chrunchy,
        donut-like baked or fried dough of wheat flour. Chin-chin may contain cowpeas but the major ingredient is flour.
