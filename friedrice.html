        <li><strong>Rinse the rice with cold watera and pour into a large pot. 
            
        </strong>Place 1 cup (178 g) of dry rice into a fine mesh strainer. Run cold water over the rice and
    use your hands to gently rinse the rice. You can use Basmatti, white or jasmine rice for this recipe</li>
    <li>Add 2 cups (473 ml) of water to the large pot. When perboiling, use twice as much water as you do rice.
        in this case, use 2 cups (473ml) of water since you're perboiling 1 cup (178g) of dry rice.
    </li> <li>Boil the mixture over high heat for 5 minutes. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, then start your timer 
        and let the rice boil for 5 minutes. Keep the lid off the pot while the liquid heats up so it doesn't boil over.
    </li><li>Transfer the rice to a fine mesh strainer. Turn off the heat and hold a fine mesh strainer over your sink.
        Pour the mixture into the strainer to drain the water from the rice.
    </li> <li>Place the strainer in a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes. Fill a large bowl with cold water, put the fine mesh 
        strainer into the bowl of water so the rice can soak for several minutes.
